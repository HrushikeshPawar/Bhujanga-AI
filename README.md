# Bhujaṅga AI

The word [Bhujanga (bhujaṅga | भुजङ्ग)](https://www.yogapedia.com/definition/6551/bhujanga), in Sanskrit means "Snake".
So this project is about creating AI to play our beloved Snake Game.

I am quite ambitious here, because the plan is to create all sorts of AI agents
possible to using path finding, various reinforcement learning algorithms, genetic learning algorithms
from very little input to passing whole game window to the agent.

So there is quite a big list of AI agents to be made.

Just starting out. Wish me luck!
